# VR-AR

Research Questions
1)	Which platform is better for the future of gaming, AR or VR?
2)	Do smartphones have scope for immersion breaking?
3)	Does VR have scope for 4th wall breaks?
4)	How do users perceive hardware media?
5)	Are 4th wall breaks agile in philosophy when experimenting different innovative hardwares?

Objective
Have 2 divisions of candidates one playing with AR, the other in VR and test their level of Immersion

Data Collection
Mixed Method – Qualitative: Survey
Quantitative: Number statistical

Method
1)	A co-op game where 2 players are given a situation to solve.
2)	Play lasts for 3 min (Psst.. will say 5 so we can make something for 3mins)
3)	Use pixel abstraction (as a design element)
4)	Player1 is in VR Player2 is an AR
5)	Study the difference and address possible elements of user interaction
6)	Probably take a situational survey test to test their response or have demonstrable responses
To Answer:
How are you testing something which hasn’t been tested previously?
How are other collaborators addressing nuisance variables for your project? (Maybe not be able to successfully eliminate them but reduce them)
Aim
Possibly discover the scope/philosophy of 4th wall breaks as a narrative device (seriously optional)
Concept
1)	Pixel abstraction moving in 3D space
2)	Both play input devices in the digital space
3)	Abstraction as concept of design and motivation for interaction (possibility)
4)	Teleport players in VR space/ Disable movement control
5)	Pixel art maybe be in a globe theatre display or flat movie screen

Key Activities
1)	Jim, Am I biting more cake than I can chew?
2)	Research production pipeline
3)	Meetings with other interested members
4)	List Reference articles for Lit Review
5)	Borrow book from CitethemRight from library
6)	Set up trello/production website project
7)	Maybe possible wikia for information as updated
8)	Game Design the play
9)	Art pipeline
10)	Source control for code
11)	Prototype
12)	Bug Test
13)	Make survey questions/ consult psy teacher for how to conduct tests.

Future Intentions
1)	Technological scope in exploring VR and AR sync // may not give
2)	If sync is successful what can happen in the future
